## Purdue Secrets

#### Social Networks, Communication

### The idea comes from various public Facebook pages, where users would submit 'secrets' anynomously to the page. However, there are some downsides for doing this on Facebook, such as the administrators of the pages would receive these 'secrets' from users, and then they need to read through these submissions one by one before posting them to the page, making sure that the post is suitable to be shown to the public.

### From my understanding, most of these pages use Google Forms for users to submit 'secrets,' and these submissions would then be added to a spreadsheet. After reviewing the submissions, they would be posted on Facebook with an number identification, either manually copy and pasting, or with the help of a middleware program.

### Therefore, I reckon I could build an app which could streamlined this whole process, with some smart features, and without the use of on other social platforms, where data security could be an issue which is not in our control.

### The technologies that are used in this web applications are:
- Python
- Flask (and multiple packages which are designed for Flask, such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask_Login, Flask-Talisman, Flask-CKEditor)
- WTForms
- Semantic-UI CSS Framework
- sqlite3
